# Youtube Auto Archiver <sub><sup>v0.7.2</sup></sub>
A simple and yet highly configurable Python application that automatically checks if a Youtuber is streaming,
and downloads said streams while also archiving its latest uploads.

The application will be improved as I have time to do so, or if you raise an issue when I have time to look into it.

## Warning
Due to the way some commands are executed, it is possible to have a
[command injection vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection)
if you mess up or leave the config file editable by everyone.<br><!--This problem **can be mitigated** if you set up the appropriate [environment variables ](#environment-variables).-->
This might be fixed in the future, but don't count on it as this project is a personal one.

The Python module named "*[lxml](https://lxml.de/)*" may fail to compile, but streamlink will work regardless since 
it is installed via the "*[py3-lxml](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=py3-lxml)*" package.

The application isn't designed to be used by another one as a module.

## Features
* General
  * Can run on Windows and Linux (*Tested on x64 and ARMv8*)
  * Relatively high level of configurability.
* YouTube
  * Automatic livestream download through <code>https://youtube.com/c/.../live</code>
  * Automatic livestream thumbnail and description download.
  * Automatic download of uploads and their metadata.
  * Configurable delays, actions, locations per channel.
* Planned for v1.0.0
  * Native support for cookies for *yt-dlp* and maybe *streamlink*.
  * Better support to prevent command injection.  (Will block some features if used)
* Planned for later
  * Using TOML for the config file when Python 3.11 is released and stable.

## Requirements
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= v3.9
* [Streamlink](https://streamlink.github.io/) >= v3.1.1, < v4.\*.\*
* [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) >= v2022.02.04

The application may work just fine with older or newer versions of these pieces of software, but they will not be supported.<br>
All requirements, except for *Python*, can be installed via *pip* or manually.

## Installation

### Standalone
1. Clone the repository and enter it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aziascreations/Youtube-Auto-Archiver.git
cd Youtube-Auto-Archiver
```

2. If desired, setup a Python virtual environment
```bash
pip install --upgrade virtualenv
python -m venv ./venv
```
* Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
* Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required Python modules
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<sup>Please note that *streamlink* may need to be compiled when installed via *pip*.<br>
You can ignore it as long as the executable is accessible in the *PATH* environment variable.</sup>

3. Configure the application's config file
4. Run the application

### Docker
1. Clone the repository and enter it
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aziascreations/Youtube-Auto-Archiver.git
cd Youtube-Auto-Archiver
```

2. Configure the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.

<sup>If you are running Docker on Windows, or on a NTFS mount under Linux, you may need to run the application as
root since the output volume binding's permissions can't be properly configured.</sup>

3. Build the container via *docker-compose*
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Config
The config is stored in [config.json](config.json) and has to be in the same folder as [app.py](app.py), unless the
appropriate [environment variables](#environment-variables) tells the application to look elsewhere for it.

Please refer to [config.md](config.md) for more information on the config file and its fields.

Regarding the configuration of this container, all you have to do is change the `/data` volume if you need it in a specific location.

## Environment Variables
Any environment variable that is not set will have the effect of its default value.

Please note that the [docker-compose.yml](docker/docker-compose.yml) files already has its environment variables set, as well as an independent config file setup.
